              <p>
                Dragons of Midgard is a playable NFT Collectible PVP game set in
                the medieval era in the kingdom of midgard. The kingdom of
                midgard comprises eight territories and each territory has
                multiple battle arenas. You need to have specific dragons to
                play each arena. Each arena yields different rewards and has
                hidden treasures which can be unlocked at the end of the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Dragon of Midgard, each dragon is the creation of multiple
                sets of attributes randomly combined through an algorithm with
                numerous inputs and screened through a thorough process ensuring
                the perfect specimen is born with distinct features
                complimenting the chemistry of traits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game requires the purchase of dragons at the beginning in
                order to be eligible to play the game. The procurement of the
                dragon will unlock the game features and all its additional
                subsidiaries. Dragons of Midgard will be available to mint at
                (coming soon).
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time of launch each dragon mint comes with some special
                rewards. Each base dragon holder will get 100 Governance tokens
                and 1000 $SOULS tokens when these tokens get public.
